## Toolkit
* [JDK v.1.8.0_65](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) - Java Development Kit. What else can I say?

* [Eclipse Java EE IDE for Web Developers v.4.5.0 (Mars)](https://www.eclipse.org) - Maybe the most famous IDE for Java developers.

* [Slick 2D Build #237](http://slick.ninjacave.com) - The game library which wraps around the LWJGL to make 2D programming in Java easier.

* [LWJGL v.2.9.3](https://www.lwjgl.org) - The famous library for game development under Java. Slick 2D wraps around the LWJGL to enable an more intuitive approach to program 2D games using LWJGL.
